# DLL-Injector
A work in progress cross platform DLL injector with support for LoadLibrary &amp; manual mapping.

Secondary goal is to add linux so injection support\
Alternative goals:\
- Add wrapper API to inject DLL files to Proton processes on Linux\
- Add cross-platform GUI to provide injection options to end-user\
- LATER: Provide any required anti-cheat preparations before injection
