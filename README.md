Primary goal is to give user options to inject a DLL to selected process (LoadLibrary & Manual Mapping)

Secondary goal is to add linux so injection support

Alternative goals:
- Add wrapper API to inject DLL files to Proton processes on Linux
- Add cross-platform GUI to provide injection options to end-user
- LATER: Provide any required anti-cheat preparations before injection
